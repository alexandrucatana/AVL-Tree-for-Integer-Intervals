This is an implementation of an AVL Tree having as node values integer intervals of the form
[4, 16]. An AVL tree is a self balancing binary search tree in which the maximum difference in height of any node's
left and right subtrees is 1, this is also called balance factor which can be defined like this:

		balance factor = height(right) - height(left)

Lookup, insertion, and deletion all take O(log n) time in both the average and worst cases, 
where n is the number of nodes in the tree prior to the operation.
